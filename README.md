### WinDocIntel2025Jan
This is a Windows Form app that uses Azure's Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer) to read lines, words and tables from an image or PDF.  It's based on Microsoft's tutorial for a console app: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api?view=doc-intel-3.0.0&preserve-view=true&pivots=programming-language-csharp  
Features I added are:
* Placing polygons (usually rectangles but sometimes parallelograms) of varying colors around each of the lines. 👍
* Placing rectangles around the tables. ❤️
* Placing a rectangle around the line that a user selects in a combo box and displaying that line's text. 😊
* Placing polygons around each word, showing the number of words and the words themselves that begin with each letter in Form4 :🤓
* The Node.js and Python folders contain some Node.js and Python action. 🐵
